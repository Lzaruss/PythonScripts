# Python Scripts

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that serve various purposes. 

## Contents

1. `passwdGen.py`: This script generates a random password of a specified length.
2. `leetTranslate.py`: This script converts natural language text into "leet" or 1337 speak.
3. `convert-TXT-to-JSON.py`: This script converts a .txt file into a JSON file.

## Usage

To use any of these scripts, clone this repository and navigate to the directory containing the script you want to use. Then, run the script using the Python interpreter.

For example, to use the password generator script, open a terminal and enter the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Lzaruss/PythonScripts.git
cd python_scripts
python passwdGen.py -f temp.txt -c 1000 -l 8
```
This example returns 1000 passwords with a length of 8 characters and will be stored in the temp.txt file (if it does not exist, it will create it).

You may need to specify additional arguments or input when running the scripts. Refer to the comments within each script for more information on their usage.
